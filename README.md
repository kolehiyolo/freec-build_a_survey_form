## Overview
### Summary
It's been a while since I actually built this project but I do remember having fun with this since the design is actually quite good aesthetic-wise. It's a solid project that also forces me to really get into forms and inputs and all that. Overall this project was really exciting

### The Challenge
- Perfectly mimic the sample page from [CodePen](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP)
- Make sure to follow the user stories dictated by freeCodeCamp
- Build it while ensuring accessibility and responsive-ness

## My process
### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS5
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
One of the significant things I learned was setting up a background image and making it work position/zoom-wise. I built this project long ago so I'm not sure what else I had a hard time with or what new stuff I learned. Perhaps I'll update this document if I remember

### Continued development
I'm not sure what skills I picked up here that offer great help with my future projects, but I do enjoy learning more about building forms through practice. I guess if there's anything I can carry later is that practice really does build skills.

### Useful resources
- [WhatTheFont!](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) - This is a stellar tool for getting the actual fonts used in any image, or at least fonts that are similar.
